1. Time log:
	- Spent two hours watching videos on tile mapping in Godot and creating and implementing tile atlases and using 
	  the different functions Godot provides to create useful tile patterns.
	- Spent an hour making prototype artwork to function as a testing tile map to create a basic test level and confirm
	  that level transitions function at a basic level.
	- Spent an hour reading Godot documentation to figure out how to implement scene transition to move between 
	  rooms in the game.
	- Spent the time in lab reading more Godot documentation on how to ensure player data is transferred during room transition
	  to the next scene.

2. Rubric (Group Made [40 points]):
	- +7 Art.
	- +6 Combat system.
	- +6 Different rooms and transitioning between them.
	- +6 In-game menu system with party, inventory, saving, and quitting.
	- +4 Inventory system.

	- +1 Movement and collision detection/handling.
	- +1 Main menu.
	- +.5 Static enemy generation in rooms
	- +.5 Story


3. Next Step:
	- For me the next step is to finish creating a full tile map to complete the game world, and finish implementing my scene
	  transitions so that all player data is stored upon transition, enemies are properly called when needed upon entering
	  a new room, and so on. I will also need to work on creating the story for the game as well as character design for our main
	  characters, and other characters and enemies within the dungeon.

4. Challenge Report:
	- This challenge went well. Our team met on time, we were direct with what everyone needed to do, when it needed to be done by,
	  and so forth. Everyone is starting early to ensure we will meet the deadline of this final project.
