Time Log: 
	3 Hours: Meeting with project partners to lay out what will happen in this game. This included talking about
			 style of play, art, different features, and other systems within the game.
	1.5 Hours: I spent time understanding gd script and learning how certain functions are used in this language.
	1.5 Hours: I made a simple load/save/delete feature that can write data to a file in order for a user to save their 
			   game while they are playing. 
	1 Hour: I couldn't figure out how to get text to show up in the buttons I made, so I spent time figuring out how to
			display text that wouldn't get in the way of my buttons for saving/loading/deleting the information.

My tasks:
	The first task I have been assigned to figure out is a feature that allows the players to load/save/delete gameplay 
	when they are in game. This will allow users to save progress and come back if needed. I am also going to sort of float
	around and help wherever help is needed. Since the load/save/delete feature was fairly simple to get a base design of,
	I will probably start picking up Minh and Kevin's tasks. I am going to design the main menu so that it is interactive
	for the player and has art, and I am going to help work on creating the players and managing their attributes.
	
Challenge Report:
	This challenge went really well for our group. We were able to meet over Discord and figure out what we 
	wanted the game to be exactly. We figured out what tasks each member will be doing and decided on how to game 
	should look to the user when they are playing. Each member seems to have a grasp on what we're going to do, and
	we each know what tasks need to be finished to reach that point.
