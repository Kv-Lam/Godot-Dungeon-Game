3 hours: Meeting with group to make an outline, plan everything (art direction, classes, features, etc.), and distrubtion of roles.
1 and 1/2 hours: Reading documentation on how to do momvement and collisions. Implemented an 8-way movement with rotational direction saving with move_and_slide().
1 and 1/2 hours: Learning and implementing collisions and detecting the object that the player collides with.
1 hour: Reading documentation on scenes and different classes. Also set up GitHub repo, basic testing scenes, a player, camera, and test enemy.
1 hour: Reading about scene switching, how to carry over data from one scene to another using singletons, and slightly about how to make save/load states using these singletons.
1 hour: Lab doing writeup and rubric.

Rubric:
+7 Art.
+6 Combat system.
+6 Different rooms and transitioning between them.
+6 In-game menu system with party, inventory, saving, and quitting.
+4 Inventory system.
+3 Load/save feature.
+3 Player stats, skills, and levels (1 per).
+2 Enemies and a range-based detection system to make them chase the player.
+1 Movement and collision detection/handling.
+1 Main menu.
+.5 Static enemy generation in rooms
+.5 Story

My tasks:
Combat system, in-game menu, inventory system, enemy range-based detection system (Detecting player if they are too close to monster and enemies chasing player), movement and collision detection/handling, main menu (Sean makes the background while I just make the buttons work), and static enemy generation (Sean will most likely take this though). These are pretty subject to change based on who is able to complete their tasks first, so if David finishes his pretty quickly then he may take a few of my tasks.

Overall, I think this challenge went well. We have a very clear idea and a good game plan on what we want to accomplish with our project. We slightly know how to implement most of it based on what we have learned while planning and doing this challenge. Hopefully we will be able to implement all of the features we want, but this is our first time working with Godot so things may change when we run into an obstacle.
